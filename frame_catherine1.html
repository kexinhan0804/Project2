<br>
<font size ="4">Our 5th generation family hang-gliding company has had its highs and lows. We have always been an outdoorsy family and that is how we started. 5 generations ago our family started a hiking and wilderness shop stocked with everything needed to survive in the outdoors. This was successful in our family until Harriet, the granddaughter of the founders stepped up with a new idea. Recently united with her husband Harry she decided that their company would pivot specifically into hang-gliding. As a child, Harriet had always loved Wilbur Wright and was fascinated with the idea of soaring through the sky. Now 2 generations after Harry and Harriet, we are as strong as ever with our wide variety of hang-gliding options and services. Still making Harry, Harriet, and Wilbur proud. </font>

<u> Here is the real question: Why does Grandma Harriet love Wilbur Wright so much?</u> 
<br>
Well, no one really knows, not even Grandpa Harry. We think it has to of with the freedom of flying. From that love of Wilbur, Harry, and Harriet were able to grow a successful business and a family who loved the freedom of hang-gliding and being up in the air. As our company has grown our message has stayed the same: help others experience the feeling of freedom that can come when you hanglide. As you explore our site, our services, and our products we hope you can see that!
